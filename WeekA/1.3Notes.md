## Network Representations

- Network diagrams, often called topology diagrams, use symbols to represent devices within the network
- Important terms to know include:
    - Network Interface Card (NIC)
    - Physical Port
    - Interface
        - *Note: Often, the terms port and interface are used interchangeably*

## Topology Diagrams

- Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation
- Logical topology illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network
