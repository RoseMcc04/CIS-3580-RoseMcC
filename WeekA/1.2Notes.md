## Host Roles

- Every computer on a network is called a host or end device
- Servers are computers that provide information to end devices
    - email servers
    - web servers
    - file server
- Clients are computers that send requests to the servers to retrieve information
    - web page from a web server
    - email from an email server

| Server Type | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Email       | Email server runs email server software.     |
| Web         | Web server runs web server software.         |
| File        | File server stores corporate and user files. |

| Server Type | Additional Details                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Email       | Clients use client software to access email. |
| Web         | Clients use browser software to access web pages. |
| File        | The client devices access these files.      |

## Peer-to-Peer

- It is possible to have a device be a client and a server in a Peer-to-Peer network. This type of network design is only recommended for very small networks.

| Advantages                          | Disadvantages                       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Easy to set up                      | No centralized administration       |
| Less complex                        | Not as secure                       |
| Lower cost                          | Not scalable                        |
| Used for simple tasks: transferring files and sharing printers | Slower performance |

## End Devices

- An end device is where a messafe originates from or where data is received. Data originates with an end device, flows through the network, and arrives at the end device.

## Intermediary Network Devices

- An intermediary device interconnects end devices. *Examples include switches, wireless access points, routers, and firewalls*.
- Management of data as it flows through a network is also the role of an intermediary device, including:
    - Regenerate and retransmit data signals
    - Maintain information about what pathways exist in the network
    - Notify other devices of errors and communication failures

## Network Media

- Communication across a network is carried through a medium which allows a message to travel from its source to its destination

| Media Types                   | Description                                              |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Metal wires within cables     | Uses electrical impulses                                 |
| Glass or plastic fibers       | Uses pulses of light                                     |
| Wireless transmission         | Uses modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves |
