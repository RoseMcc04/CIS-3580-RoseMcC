## Networks of Many Sizes

- Small Home Networks - connect a few computers to each other and the internet
- Small Office/Home Office - enables computer within a home or remote office to connect to a corporate network
- Medium to Large Networks - many locations within hundreds or thousands of interconnected computers
- World Wide Networks - connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide - such as the internet

## LANs and WANs

- Network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of:
    - Size of the area covered
    - Number of users connected
    - Number and types of services available
    - Area of responsibility
- Two most common types of networks:
    - Local Area Network (LAN)
    - Wide Area Network (WAN)
- LAN - network infrastructure that spans a small geographical area
- WAN - network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area

| LAN                                      | WAN                                              |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Interconnect end devices in a limited area. | Interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas.  |
| Administered by a single organization or individual. | Typically administered by one or more service providers. |
| Provide high-speed bandwidth to internal devices.    | Typically provide slower speed links between LANs.       |

## The Internet

- The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected LANs and WANs
    - LANs are connected to each other using WANs
    - WANs may use copper wires, fiber optic cables, and wireless transmissions
- The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The following groups were developed to help maintain the structure of the internet:
    - IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
    - ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
    - IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau)

## Intranets and Extranets

- An intranet is a private collection of LANs and WANs internal to an organization that is meant to be accessible only to the organization's members or others with authorization
- An organization might use an extranet to provide secure access to their network for individuals who work for a different organization that need access to their data on their network
