## Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling

- Not as common as UTP because of the expense involved
- Ideal for some networking scenarios
- Transmits data over longer distances at higher handwidth than any other networking media
- Less susceptible to attenuation, and completely immune to EMI/RFI
- Made of flexible, extremely thin strands of very pure glass
- Uses a laser or LED to encode bits as pulses of light
- The fiber-optic cable acts as a wave guide to transmit light between the two ends with minimal signal loss

## Types of Fiber Media

- Single-Mode Fiber
    - Very small core
    - Uses expensive lasers
    - Long-distance applications
- Multimode Fiber
    - Larger core
    - Uses less expensive LEDs
    - LEDs transmit at different angles
    - Up to 10 Gbps over 550 meters
- Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time. Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength. MMF has greater dispersion than SMF, with a the maximum cable distance for MMF is 550 meters

## Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage

- Fiber-optic cabling is now being used in four types of industry:
    - **1. Enterprise Networks -** Used for backbone cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices
    - **2. Fiber-to-the-Hoem -** Used to provide always-on broadband services to homes and small businesses
    - **3. Long-Haul Networks -** Used by service providers to connect countries and cities
    - **4. Submarine Cable Networks -** Used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity solutions capable of surviving in harsh undersea environments at up to transoceania distances

## Fiber Patch Cords

- A yellow jacket is for single-mode fiber cables and orange (or aqua) for multimode fiber cables

## Fiber-Optic vs. Copper

- Optical fiber is primarily used as backbone cabling for high-traffic, point-to-point connections between data distribution facilities and for the interconnection of buildings in multi-building campuses

| Implementation Issues            | UTP Cabling              | Fiber-Optic Cabling       |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
