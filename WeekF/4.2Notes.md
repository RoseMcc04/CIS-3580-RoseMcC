## Physical Layer Standards

- The TCP/IP standards are implemented in software and governed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- The physical layer standards are implemented in hardware and are governed by many organizations including:
    - ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
    - EIA/TIA (Electronics Industries Alliance/Telecommunications Industry Association)
    - ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector)
    - ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
    - IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

## Physical Components

- Physical Layer Standards address three functional areas:
    - Physical Components
    - Encoding
    - Signaling
- The Physical Components are the hardware devices, media, and other connectors that transmit the signals that represent the bits
    - Hardware components like NICs, interfaces and connectors, cable materials, and cable designs are all specified in standards associated with the physical layer

## Encoding

- Encoding converts the stream of bits into a format recognizable by the next device in the network path
- This 'coding' provides predictable patterns that can be recognized by the next device
- Examples of encoding methods include Manchester (shown in figure), 4B/5B, and 8B/10B

## Signaling

- The signaling method is how the bit values, "1" and "0" are represented on the physical medium
- The method of signaling will vary based on the type of medium being used

## Bandwidth

- Bandwidth is the capacity at which a medium can carry data
- Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time; how many bits can be transmitted in a second
- Physical media properties, current technologies, and the laws of physics play a role in determining available bandwidth

| **Unit of Bandwidth**    | **Abbreviation** | **Equivalence**               |
|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Bits per second          | bps             | 1 bps = fundamental unit of bandwidth |
| Kilobits per second      | Kbps            | 1 Kbps = 1,000 bps = 10³ bps    |
| Megabits per second      | Mbps            | 1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps = 10⁶ bps |
| Gigabits per second      | Gbps            | 1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bps = 10⁹ bps |
| Terabits per second      | Tbps            | 1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps = 10¹² bps |

## Bandwidth Terminology

- Latency
    - Amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another
- Throughput
    - The measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time
- Goodput
    - The measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time
    - Goodput = Throughput - traffic overheadnc
