## The Physical Connection

- Before any network connections can occur, a physical connection to a local network must be established
- This connection could be wired or wireless, depending on the setup of the network
- This generally applies whether you are considering a corporate office or a home
- A Network Interface Card (NIC) connects a device to the network
- Some devices may have just one NIC, while others may have multiple NICs (Wired and/or Wireless, for example)
- Not all physical connections offer the same level of performance

## The Physical Layer

- Transports bits across the network media
- Accepts a complete frame from the Data Link Layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted to the local media
- This is the last step in the encapsulation process
- The next device in the path to the destination receives the bits and re-encapsulates the frame, then decides what to do with it
