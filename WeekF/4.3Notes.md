## Characteristics of Copper Cabling

- Copper cabling is the most common type of cabling used in networks today. It is inexpensive, easy to install, and has low resistance to electrical current flow
- Limitations:
    - Attenutation - the longer the electrical signals have to travel, the weaker they get
    - The electrical signal is susceptible to interference from two sources, which can distort and corrupt the data signals (Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) and Crosstalk)
- Mitigation:
    - Strict adherence to cable length limits will mitigate attenuation
    - Some kinds of copper cable can mitigate EMI and RFI by using metallic shielding and grounding
    - Some kinds of copper cable mitigate crosstalk by twisting opposing circuit pair wires together

## Types of Copper Cabling

- Unshielded Twisted-Pair (UTP) Cable
- Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable (STP)
- Coaxial Cable

## Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)

- UTP is the most common networking media
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- Interconnects hosts with intermediary network devices
- Key characteristics of UTP:
    1. The outer jacket protects the copper wires from physical damage
    2. Twisted pairs protect the signal from interference
    3. Color-coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wiress from each other and identifies the pair

## Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

- Better noise protection than UTP
- More expensive than UTP
- Harder to install than UTP
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- Interconnects hosts with intermediary network devices
- Key characteristics of STP:
    1. The outer jacket protects the copper wires from physical damage
    2. Braided or foil shield provides EMI/RFI protection
    3. Foil shield for each pair of wires provides EMI/RFI protection
    4. Color-coded plastic insulation electrically isolates the wires from each other and identifies the pair

## Coaxial Cable

- Consists of the following:
    1. Outer cable hacket to prevent minor physical damage
    2. A woven copper braid, or metallic foil, acts as the second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor
    3. A layer of flexible plastic insulation
    4. A copper conductor is used to transmit the electronic signals
- There a different types of connectors used with coaxial cable
- Commonly used in the following situations:
    - Wireless installations - attach antennas to wireless devices
    - Cable internet installations - customer premises wiring
