## Properties of Wireless Media

- It carries electromagnetic signals representing binary digits using radio or microwave frequencies. This provides the greatest mobility option. Wireless connection numbers continue to increase
- Some of the limitations of wireless:
    - **Coverage area** - Effective coverage can be significantly impacted by the physical characteristics of the deployment location
    - **Interference** - Wireless is susceptible to interference and can be disrupted by many common devices
    - **Security** - Wireless communication coverage requires no access to a physical strand of media, so anyone can gain access to the transmission
    - **Shared medium** - WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one devie can send or receive at a time. Many users accessing the WLAN simultaneously results in reduced bandwidth for each user

## Types of Wireless Media

- The IEEE and telecommunications industry standards for wireless data communications cover both the data link and physical layers. In each of these standards, physical layer specifications dictate:
    - Data to radio signal encoding methods
    - Frequency and power of transmission
    - Signal reception and decoding requirements
    - Antenna design and construction
- Wireless Standards:
    - **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)** - Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology
    - **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)** - Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) standard
    - **WiMAX (IEEE 802.16)** - Uses a point-to-multipoint topology to provide broadband wireless access
    - **Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)** - Low data-rate, low power-consumption communications, primarily for Internet of Things (IoT) applications

## Wireless LAN (WLAN)

- In general, a Wireless LAN (WLAN) requires the following devices:
    - **Wireless Access Point (AP)** - Concentrate wireless signals from users and connect to the existing copper-based network infrastructure
    - **Wireless NIC Adapters** - Provide wireless communications capability to network hosts
- There are a number of WLAN standards. When purchasing WLAN equipment, ensure compatability, and interoperability
- Network Administrators must develop and apply stringent security policies and processes to protect WLANs from unauthorized access and damage
