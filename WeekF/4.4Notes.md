## Properties of UTP Cabling

- UTP has four pairs of color-coded copper wires twisted together and encased in a flexible plastic sheath. No shielding is used. UTP relies on the following properties to limit crosstalk:
    - Cancellation - Each wire in a pair of wires uses opposite polarity. One wire is negative, the other wire is positive. They are twisted together and the magnetic fields effectively cancel each other and outside EMI/RFI
    - Variation in twists per foot in each wire - Each wire is twisted in a different amount, which helps prevent crosstalk amongst the wires in the cable

## UTP Cabling Standards and Connectors

- Standards for UTP are established by the TIA/EIA. TIA/EIA-568 standardizes elements like:
    - Cable types
    - Cable lengths
    - Connectors
    - Cable termination
    - Testing methods
- Electrical standards for copper cabling are established by the IEEE, which rates cable according to its performance; examples include:
    - Category 3
    - Category 5/5e
    - Category 6

## Straight-Through and Crossover UTP Cables

| Cable Type                 | Standard                        | Application                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ethernet Straight-through  | Both ends T568A or T568B       | Host to Network Device                                                                         |
| Ethernet Crossover *       | One end T568A, other end T568B | Host-to-Host, Switch-to-Switch, Router-to-Router                                              |
| Rollover                   | Cisco Proprietary              | Host serial port to Router or Switch Console Port, using an adapter                           |

*Considered Legacy due to most NICs using Auto-MDIX to sense cable type and complete connection.*
