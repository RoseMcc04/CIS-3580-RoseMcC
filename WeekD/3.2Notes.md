## Network Protocol Overview

- Network protocols define a common set of rules
- Can be implemented in devices in:
    - Software
    - Hardware
    - Both
- Protocols have their own:
    - Function
    - Format
    - Rules

| **Protocol Type**       | **Description** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Network Communications** | Enable two or more devices to communicate over one or more networks (TCP, HTTP, SMTP, etc.). |
| **Network Security** | Secure data to provide authentication, data integrity, and data encryption (SSH, SSL, TLS). |
| **Routing** | Enable routers to exchange route information, compare path information, and select the best path (OSPF, BGP). |
| **Service Discovery** | Used for the automatic detection of devices or services (DHCP, DNS). |

## Network Protocol Functions

- Devices use agreed-upon protocols to communicate
- Protocols may have one or more functions

| **Function**            | **Description** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Addressing** | Identifies sender and receiver (Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6). |
| **Reliability** | Provides guaranteed delivery (TCP). |
| **Flow Control** | Ensures data flows at an efficient rate (TCP). |
| **Sequencing** | Uniquely labels each transmitted segment of data (TCP). |
| **Error Detection** | Determines if data became corrupted during transmission (Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, TCP). |
| **Application Interface** | Process-to-process communications between network applications (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc.). |

## Protocol Interaction

- Networks require the use of several protocols
- Each protocol has its own function and format

| **Protocol** | **Function** |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** | Governs the way a web server and a web client interact. Defines content and format. |
| **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** | Manages the individual conversations. Provides guaranteed delivery. Manages flow control. |
| **Internet Protocol (IP)** | Delivers messages globally from the sender to the receiver. |
| **Ethernet** | Delivers messages from one NIC to another NIC on the same Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN). |
