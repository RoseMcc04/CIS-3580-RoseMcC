## Network Protocol Suites

- Protocols must be able to work with other protocols
- Protocol suite:
    - A group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function
    - Sets of rules that work together to help solve a problem
- The protocols are viewed in terms of layers:
    - Higher Layers
    - Lower Layers - concerned with moving data and provide services to the upper layers

## Evolution of Protocol Suites

- There are several protocol suites:
    - **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)**: The most common protocol suite and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
    - **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Protocols**: Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
    - **AppleTalk**: Proprietary suite release by Apple Inc. (no longer used)
    - **Novell NetWare**: Proprietary suite developed by Novell Inc. (no longer used)

## *TCP/IP Protocol Example*

- TCP/IP protocols operate at the application, transport, and internet layers
- The most common network access layer LAN protocols are Ethernet and WLAN (wireless LAN)
- No TCP/IP protocol at Network Access Layer
- Network access layers deliver IP packets over the physical medium

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite

- TCP/IP is the protocol suite used by the internet and includes many protocols
- TCP/IP is:
    - An open standard protocol suite that is freely available to the public and can be used by any vendor
    - A standards-based protocol suite that is endorsed by the networking industry and approved by a standards organization to ensure interoperability

## TCP/IP Communication Process

- A web server encapsulating and sending a web page to a client
- A client de-encapsulating the web page for the web browser
