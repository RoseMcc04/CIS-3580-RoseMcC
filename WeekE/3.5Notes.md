## The Benefits of Using a Layered Model

- Complex concepts such as how a network operates can be difficult to explain and understand. For this reason, a layered model is used
- Two layered models describe network operations:
    - Open System Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model
    - TCP/IP Reference Model

- These are the benefits of using a layered model:
    - Assist in protocol design because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above and below
    - Foster competition because products from different vendors can work together
    - Prevent technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers above or below
    - Provide a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities

## The OSI Reference Model

| OSI Model Layer | Description |
|-----------------|------------|
| **7 - Application** | Contains protocols used for process-to-process communications. |
| **6 - Presentation** | Provides for common representation of the data transferred between application layer services. |
| **5 - Session** | Provides services to the presentation layer and to manage data exchange. |
| **4 - Transport** | Defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications. |
| **3 - Network** | Provides services to exchange the individual pieces of data over the network. |
| **2 - Data Link** | Describes methods for exchanging data frames over a common media. |
| **1 - Physical** | Describes the means to activate, maintain, and de-activate physical connections. |

## The TCP/IP Reference Model

| TCP/IP Model Layer  | Description |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Application**     | Represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control. |
| **Transport**       | Supports communication between various devices across diverse networks. |
| **Internet**        | Determines the best path through the network. |
| **Network Access**  | Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network. |

## OSI and TCP/IP Model Comparison

- The OSI model divides the network access layer and the application layer of the TCP/IP model into multiple layers
- The TCP/IP protocol suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium
- OSI layers 1 and 2 discuss the necessary procedures to access the media and physical means to send data over a network
