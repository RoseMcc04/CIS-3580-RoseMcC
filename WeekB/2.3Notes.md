## Basic IOS Command Structure

```shell
Switch>show ip protocols
PROMPT COMMAND SPACE KEYWORD/ARGUMENT
Switch>ping 192.168.10.5
```

## IOS Command Syntax Check

- A command might require one or more arguments. To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax
    - Boldface text indicates commands and keywords that are entered as shown
    - Italic text indicates an argument for which the user provides the value

|  Convention | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
|**boldface** |Boldface text indicates commands and keywords that you enter literally as shown. |
| *italics*   |Italic text indicates arguments for which you supply values. |
|   `[x]`     |Square Brackets indicate an optional element (keyword or argument). |
|   `{x}`     |Braces indicate a required element (keyword or argument). |
|`[x {y l z}]`|Braces and vertical lines within square brackets indicate a required choice within an optional element. Spaces are used to clearly delineate parts of the command. |

- The command syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command
- The command is **ping** and the user-defined argument is the *ip-address*. *For instance, **ping 10.10.10.5**.*
- The command is **traceroute** and the user-defined argument is the *ip-address* of the destination device. *For instance, **traceroute 192.168.254.254**.*
- If a command is complex with multiple arguments, you may see it represented like this:
```shell
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security aging { static | time time | type (absolute | inactivity)}
```

## IOS Help Features

- The IOS has two forms of help available: context-sensitive help and command syntax check
    - Context-sensitive helps to enable you to quickly find answers to the following questions:
        - Which commands are available in each command mode?
        - Which commands start with specific characters or group of characters?
        - Which arguments and keywords are available to particular commands?
```shell
Router$ping ?
    WORD Ping destination address or hostname
    ip IP echo
    ipv6 IPv6 echo
```
    - Command syntax check verifies that a valid command was entered by the user
        - If the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide feedback describing what is wrong with the command
```shell
Switch$interface fastEthernet 0/1
                 ^
% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.
```

## Hot Keys and Shortcuts

- The IOS CLI provides hot keys and shortcuts that make configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting easier
- Commands and keywords can be shortened to the minimum number of characters that identify a unique selection, For instance, the **configure** command can be shortened to **conf** because **configure** is the only command that begins with **conf**
```shell
Router$con
% Ambiguous command: "con"
Router$con?
configure correct
```

```shell
Router$conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
Router(config)#
```

| Keystroke                   | Description     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
|**Tab**                      |Completes a partial command name entry. |
|**Backspace**                |Erases the character to the left of the cursor. |
|**Left Arrow** or **Ctrl+B** |Move the cursor one character to the left. |
|**Right Arrow** or **Ctrl+F**|Moves the cursor one character to the right. |
|**Up Arrow** or **Ctrl+P**   |Recalls the commands in the history buffer, beginning with the most recent commands. |
|**Enter** Key                |Displays the next line. |
|**Space** Bar                |Displays the next screen. |
|Any other key                |Ends the display string, returning to privileged EXEC mode. |
|**Ctrl+C**                   |When in any configuration mode, ends the configuration mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode. |
|**Ctrl+Z**                   |When in any configuration mode, ends the configuration mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode. |
|**Ctrl+Shift+6**             |All-purpose break sequence used to abort DNS lookups, traceroutes, pings, etc. |

- When a command output produces more text than can be displayed in a terminal window, the IOS will display a **"--More--"** prompt. The table above describes the keystrokes that can be used when this prompt is displayed, along with commands that can be used to exit an operation.

## Packet Tracer - Navigate the IOS

- In this Packet Tracer, you will do the following:
    - Establish Basic Connections, Access the CLI, and Explore Help
    - Explore EXEC Modes
    - Set the Clock
