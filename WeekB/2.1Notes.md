## Operating Systems

- **Shell**
    - The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer. These requests can be made either through the CLI or GUI interfaces. 
- **Kernel**

## GUI

- A GUI allows the user to interact with the system using an environment of graphical icons, menus, and windows.
- A GUI is more user-friendly and requires less knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the system.
- *Examples of these are: Windows, macOS, Linux KDE, Apple iOS, and Android*
- GUIs can fail, crash, or simply not operate as specified. For these reasons, network devices are typically accessed through a CLI.

## Purpose of an OS

- PC operating system enables a user to do the following:
    - Use a mouse to make selections and run programs
    - Enter text and text-based commands
- CLI-based network operating system enables a network technician to do the following:
    - Use a keyboard to run CLI-based network programs
    - Use a keyboard to enter text and text-based commands
    - View output on a monitor

## Access Methods

- **Console**
    - A physical management port used to access a device in order to provide maintenance, such as performing the initial configuration.
- **Secure Shell (SSH)**
    - Establishes a secure remote CLI connection to a device, through a virtual interface, over a network.
- **Telnet**
    - Establishes an insecure remote CLI connection to a device over the network.

## Terminal Emulation Programs

- Terminal emulation programs are used to connect to a network device by either a console port or by an SSH/Telnet connection.
- There are several terminal emulator programs to choose from such as PuTTY, Tera Term, and SecureCRT.
