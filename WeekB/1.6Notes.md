## Network Architecture

- Network Architecture refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure that moves data across the network
- There are four basic characteristics that the underlying architectures need to address to meet user expectations:
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Scalability
    - Quality of Service (QoS)
    - Security

## Fault Tolerance

- A fault tolerant network limits the impact of a failure by limiting the number of affected devices. Multiple paths are required for fault tolerance.
- Reliable networks provide redundancy by implementing a packet switched network:
    - Packet switching splits traffic into packets that are routed over a network
    - Each packet could theoretically take a different path to the destination
- This is not possible without circuit-switched networks which establish dedicated circuits

## Scalability

- A scalable network can expand quickly and easily to support new users and applications without impacting the performance of services to existing users
- Network designers follow accepted standards and protocols in order to make the networks scalable

## Quality of Service (QoS)

- Voice and live video transmissions require higher expectations for those services being delivered
- Have you ever watched a live video with constant breaks and pauses? This is caused when there is a higher demand for bandwidth than available - and QoS is not configured
    - Quality of Service (QoS) is the primary mechanism used to ensure reliable delivery of content for all users
    - With a QoS policy in place, the router can more easily manage the flow of data and voice traffic

## Network Security

- There are two main types of network security that must be addressed:
    - Network Infrastructure Security
        - Physical security of network devices
        - Preventing unauthorized access to the devices
    - Information Security
        - Protection of the information or data transmitted over the network
- Three goals of network security:
    - Confidentiality - only intended recipients can read the data
    - Integrity - assurance that the data has not been altered during transmission
    - Availability - assurance of timely and reliable access to data for authorized users
