## Manual IP Address Configuration for End Devices

- End devices on the network need an IP address in order to communicate with other devices on the network
- IPv4 address information can be entered into end devices manually, or automatically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    - To manually configure an IPv4 address on a Windows PC, open the **Control Panel > Network Sharing Center > Change adapter settings** and choose the adapter. Next, right-click and select **Properties** to display the **Local Area Connection Properties**
    - Next, click **Properties** to open the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties** window. Then, configure the IPv4 address and subnet mask information, along with the default gateway

## Automatic IP Address Configuration for End Devices

- DCHP enables automatic IPv4 address configuration for every end device that is DCHP-enabled
- End devices are typically by default using DHCP for automatic IPv4 address configuration
    - To configure DHCP on a Windows PC, open the **Control Panel > Network Sharing Center > Change adapter settings** and choose the adapter. Next, right-click and select **Properties** to display the **Local Area Connection Properties**
    - Next, click **Properties** to open the **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) properties** window, then select **Obtain an IP address automatically** and **Obtain DNS server address automatically**

## Switch Virtual Interface Configuration

- To access the switch remotely, an IP address and a subnet mask must be configured on the SVI
- To configure an SVI on a switch:
    - Enter the **interface vlan 1** command in global configuration mode
    - Next, assign an IPv4 address using the **ip address** *ip-address subnet-mask* command
    - Finally, enable the virtual interface using the **no shutdown** command
