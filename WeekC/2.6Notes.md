## IP Addresses

- The use of IP addresses is the primary means of enabling devices to locate one another and establish end-to-end communication on the internet
- The structure of an IPv4 address is called dotted decimal notation and is represented by four decimal numbers between 0 and 255
- An IPV4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that differentiates the network portion of the address from the host portion. Coupled with the IPv4 address, the subnet mask determines to which subnet the device is a member
- The default gateway address is the IP address of the router that the host will use to access remote networks, including the internet
- IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and are written as a string of hexadecimal values. Every four bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. Groups of four hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon `:`
- IPv6 addresses are NOT case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase
- ***Note**: IP in this course refers to BOTH the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IPv6 is the most recent version of IP and is replacing the more common IPv4*

## Interfaces and Ports

- Network communications depend on end user device interfaces, networking device interfaces, and the cables that connect them
- Types of network media include twisted-pair copper cables, fiber-optic tables, coaxial cables, or wireless
- Different types of network media have different features and benefits. Some of the differences between various types of media include:
    - Distance the media can successfully carry a signal
    - Environment in which the media is to be installed
    - Amount of data and the speed at which it must be transmitted
    - Cost of the media and installation
