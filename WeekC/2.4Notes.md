## Device Names

- The first configuration command on any device should be to give it a unique hostname
- By default, all devices are assigned a factory default name. *For instance, a Cisco IOS Switch is "Switch"*
- Guidelines for naming devices:
    - Start with a letter
    - Contain no spaces
    - End with a letter or digit
    - Use only letters, digits, and dashes
    - Be less than 64 characters in length
```shell
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# hostname Sw-Floor-1
Sw-Floor-1(config)#
```
- *Note: To return the switch to the default prompt, use the **no hostname** global config command.*

## Password Guidelines

- The use of weak or easily guessed passwords are a security concern
- All networking devices should limit administrative access by securing privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and remote Telnet access with passwords. In addition, all passwords should be encrypted and legal notifications provided
- Password guidelines:
    - Use passwords that are greater than eight characters in length
    - Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences
    - Avoid using the same password for all devices
    - Do not use common words because they are easily guessed
- *Note: Most of the labs in this course use simple passwords such as **cisco** or **class**. These passwords are considered weak and easily guessable and should be avoided in production environments*

## Configure Passwords

- Securing user EXEC mode access:
    - First, enter line console configuration mode using the **line console 0** command in global configuration mode
    - Next, specify the user EXEC mode password using the **password** *password* command
    - Finally, enable user EXEC access using the **login** command
- Securing privileged EXEC mode access:
    - First, enter global configuration mode
    - Next, use the **enable secret** *password* command
- Securing VTY line access:
    - First, enter line VTY configuration mode using the **line vty 0 15** comand in global configuration mode
    - Next, specify the VTY password using the **password** *password* command
    - Finally, enable VTY access using the **login** command
    - *Note: VTY lines enable remote access using Telnet or SSH to the device. Many Cisco switches support up to 16 VTY lines that are numbered 0 to 15*

## Encrypt Passwords

- The startup-config and running-config files display most passwords in plain text
- To encrypt all plaintext passwords, use the **service password-encryption** global config command
- Use the **show running-config** command to verify that the passwords on the device are now encrypted
```shell
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# service password-encryption
Sw-Floor-1(config)# exit
Sw-Floor-1#
```

```shell
Sw-Floor-1# show running-config
!

!
line con 0
password 7 094F471A1A0A
login
!
Line vty 0 4
Password 7 03095A0F34F38435B49150A1819
Login
!
!
end
```

## Banner Messages

- A banner message is important to warn unauthorized personnel from attempting to access the device
- To create a banner message of the day on a network device, use the **banner motd** *# the message of the day #* global config command
- *Note: The "#" in the command syntax is called the delimiting character. It is entered before and after the message*
