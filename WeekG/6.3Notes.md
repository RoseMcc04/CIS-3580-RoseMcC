## The Frame

- Data is encapsulated by the data link layer with a header and a trailer to form a frame
- A data link frame has three parts:
    - Header
    - Data
    - Trailer
- The fields of the header and trailer vary according to the data link layer protocol
- The amount of control information and trailer vary according to data link layer protocol

## Frame Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Frame Start and Stop | Identifies beginning and end of frame (frame is coming and ending) |
| Addressing | Indicates source and destination nodes (physical) |
| Type | Identifies encapsulated Layer 3 protocol-the type of data that is encapsulated (protocol) |
| Control | Identifies flow control services-allows for communication at different speeds on the network |
| Data | Contains the frame payload |
| Error Detection | Used for determine transmission errors |

## Layer 2 Addresses

| Layer 2 Address Format | Bits per Part |
|---|---|
| Preamble | 7 bytes (56 bits) |
| Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) | 1 byte (8 bits) |
| Destination MAC Address | 6 bytes (48 bits) |
| Source MAC Address | 6 bytes (48 bits) |
| EtherType/Length | 2 bytes (16 bits) |
| Data (Payload) | Variable |
| Frame Check Sequence (FCS) | 4 bytes (32 bits) |

- Also referred to as a physical address
- Contained in the frame header
- Used only for local delivery of a frame on the link
- Updated by each device that forwards the frame

## LAN and WAN Frames

- The logical topology and physical media determine the data link protocol used:
    - **Ethernet**
    - **802.11 Wireless**
    - Point-to-Point (PPP)
    - High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
    - Frame-Relay
- Each protocol performs media access control for specified logical topologies
