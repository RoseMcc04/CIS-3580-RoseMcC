## The Data Link Layer

- The Data Link layer is responsible for communications between end-device network interface cards
- It allows upper layer protocols to access the physical layer media and encapsulates Layer 3 packets (IPv4 and IPv6) into Layer 2 Frames
- It also performs error detection and rejects corruption frames
- Layer 2 deals with the physical addresses unlike Layer 3 which is hierarchical

## IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Data Link Sublayers

- IEEE 802 LAN/MAN standards are specific to the type of network (Ethernet, WLAN, WPAN, etc)
- The Data Link Layer consists of two sublayers:
    - **Logical Link Control (LLC)**
        - The LLC sublayer communicates between the networking software at the upper layers and the device hardware at the lower layers
        - Frames Network Layer Packet and identifies the Network Protocol
    - **Media Access Control (MAC)**
        - The MAC sublayer is responsible for data encapsulation and media access control
        - Addresses the frame and marks the beginning and end of the frame

## Providing Access to Media

- Packets exchanged between nodes may experience numerous data link layers and media transitions
    - *Ethernet to wireless, wireless to satellite, ethernet to cellular*
- At each hop along the path, a router performs four basic Layer 2 functions:
    - Accepts a frame from the network medium
    - De-encapsulates the frame to expose the encapsulated packet
    - Re-encapsulates the packet into a new frame
    - Checks for errors in length
    - Forwards the new frame on the medium of the next network segment

## Data Link Layer Standards

- Data link layer protocols are defined by engineering organizations:
    - Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
    - International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
    - International Organizations for Standardization (ISO)
    - American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
