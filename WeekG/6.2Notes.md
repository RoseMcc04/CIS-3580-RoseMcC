## Physical and Logical Topologies

- The topology of a network is the arrangement and relationship of the network devices and the interconnections between them
- There are two types of topologies used when describing networks:
    - **Physical topology** - shows physical connections and how devices are interconnected
    - **Logical topology** - identifies the virtual connections between devices using device interfaces and IP addressing schemes

## WAN Topologies

- There are three common physical WAN topologies:
    - **Point-to-point** - the simplest and most common WAN topologu. Consists of a permanent link between two endpoints
    - **Hub and spoke** - similar to a star topology where a central site interconnects branch sites through point-to-point links
    - **Mesh** - provides high availability but requires every end system to be connected to every other end system

### Point-to-Point Topology

- Physical point-to-point topologies directly connect two nodes
- The nodes may not share the media with other hosts
- Because all frames on the media can only travel to or from the two nodes, Point-to-Point WAN protocols can be very simple

## LAN Topologies

- End devices on LANs are typically interconnected using a star or extended star topology. Star and extended star topologies are very easy to install, very scalable, and easy to troubleshoot
- Early Ethernet and Legacy Token Ring technologies provide two additional topologies:
    - **Bus** - All end systems chained together and terminated on each end
    - **Ring** - Each end system is connected to its respective neighbors to form a ring

## Half and Full Duplex Communication

- **Half-duplex communication**
    - Only allows one device to send or receive at a time on a shared medium
    - Used on WLANs and legacy bus topologies with Ethernet hubs
- **Full-duplex communication**
    - Allows both devices to simultaneously transmit and receive on a shared medium
    - Ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode

## Access Control Methods

- **Contention-based access**
    - All nodes operating in half-duplex, competing for use of the medium. Examples are:
        - Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) as used on kegacy bus-topology Ethernet
        - Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) are used on Wireless LANs
- **Controlled access**
    - Deterministic access where each node has its own time on the medium
    - Used on legacy networks such as Token Ring and ARCNET

## Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CD

- **CSMA/CD**
    - Used by legacy Ethernet LANs
    - Operates in half-duplex mode where only one device sends or receives at a time
    - Uses a collision detection process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time
- **CSMA/CS collision detection process**
    - Devices transmitting simultaneously will result in a signal collision on the shared media
    - Devices detect the collision
    - Devices wait a random period and retransmit data

## Contention-Based Access - CSMA/CD

- **CSMA/CA**
    - Used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs
    - Operates in half-duplex mode where only one device sends or receives at a time
    - Uses a collision avoidance process to govern when a device can send and what happens if multiple devices send at the same time
- **CSMA/CA collision avoidance process**
    - When transmitting, devices also include the time duration needed for the transmittion
    - Other devices on the shared medium receive the time duration information and know how long the medium will be unavailable
